# Tarballs folder

We need to generate tarballs to run project locally.
Use `yarn build` in package folders to pack them and put here.

Tests (from `__test__` folder) and scripts (from `./scripts` folder) rely on tarballs.

**Note**: you can use `yarn dev` in `./packages/cdk-scripts` to build the tarball continuously.
